# ArMatrix
Web application for creating pixel art (colorful 2D matrices)

[Launch app](https://tomobossi.github.io/ArMatrix/)

I started this project with the idea of making a simple and intuitive 2D matrix creation and modification tool for the purpose of designing simple levels for simple 2D games. 
I got carried away and ended up making a kind-of-usable although very primitive pixel art tool. Might as well share it and keep older versions in case I fuck things up.

ArMatrix not because of my forever throbbing and almost insufferable argentinian pride, but because you are meant to (ar)mar tu (matriz).

Does not work on mobile.
